# Inspiration
Due to COVID-19, many students were being isolated from other classmates. We have gone through this difficult time for last couple of years, and one of the disadvantage was that it was hard to make new friends and talk to classmates.

# What it does
Our application is designed to use the college login database to parse the enrollment data of the students and make corresponding chatrooms for each course. It will also make a schedule graph, and students are able to view the course information.

# How we built it
We designed each screen by drawing and starts to make HTML files for each screen. After we have done making blueprints of the application, we have started putting in designs and CSS styles to HTML. Then, using the Electron JS, we started to connect those screens using buttons.

# Challenges we ran into
All of us were not familiar with front-end development. Two of us never have done programming, and other two had very least amount of experience to web development. Additionally, HTML, CSS, and Javascript does not specifically tell us where we have made a mistake, it was very difficult for us to find the error and spent much more time debugging then actual development.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
This was our first time in Hackathon, and it was also our first time building an application using Electron JS, HTML, CSS. We have made a huge progress throughout this project. Web development was not easy for us, but we made great progress even when we could not complete the all features of the application that we have planned.

# What we learned
We learned the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and use of Electron JS. Two of our team members who were not familiar with programming at all got a chance to learn and understand how coding works. Most importantly, we have shared our opinions and thought together for the idea, and we are very proud that our team with no experience in hackathon could have made this much progress throughout this event.

# What's next for What's Up MATE
It is significant for us to complete the features and necessary designs and functions for the application. Other bug fixes are also needed.
